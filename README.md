# aerovaldb - Database combining aeroval and pyaerocom


## About

aerovaldb is the database-interface using in the aeroval-API to send data to
aeroval database instances like https://aeroval.met.no . Data is usually provided
by [PyAerocom](https://pyaerocom.readthedocs.io).

The scope of aerovaldb are:

1. A well-tested read-interface for reading resources as python-object, json or json_filehandle.
2. A interface to write/extend python objects to the resources2.
3. At least one implementation (largely based on json files) implementing the read-interface. (needed for testing)
4. At least one implementation (largely based on json files) implementing the write-interface.

## Design principles

1. As pyaerocom-programmer using aerovaldb I want to have documented functions with arguments, e.g. `put_heatmap(hm, country, component)`
2. From a DB-implementer I want to have a resource-name (table/path) with parameters as dictionary, e.g.
    `open(f"path/to/heatmaps/{country}/{component}.json")` or `SELECT * FROM PATH_TO_HEATMAPS where country = ? and component = ?`
3. As Web-developer using aerovaldb, I have to map routes to function, and I have parameters for the routes.
4. For performance, I want to avoid unnecessary json/obj transformations, so I want to put/get obj or json or filehandle
   and the database might want to decide how to handle that fastest. obj should be the default, json is required,
   filehandle is optional (and only for get-operations.).


## Installation
`python -m pip install 'pyaro@git+https://github.com/metno/aerovaldb.git'`


## Usage

### Reader, e.g. webserver

```python

from aerovaldb.jsonfiledb import AerovalJsonFileDB

with AerovalJsonFileDB('path/to/data/') as db:
    try:
        fh = db.get_geojson_map(type=JSON_FILEHANDLE)
        # ... sendfile of filehandle
    catch FileHandleNotAvailableException ex:
        json = db.get_geosjon_map(type=JSON)
        # ... send json string to client

```

### Writer

```python
from aerovaldb.jsonfiledb import AerovalJsonFileDB

with AerovalJsonFileDB('path/to/data/') as db:
    obj = db.get_model_timeseries(type=OBJ) # type=OBJ is default
    obj["new_model"] = modeltimeseries
    db.put_model_timeseries(obj, type=OBJ) # type=OBJ is default

```
